In the realm of code, where bits and bytes unite,
Lies assembly, a language that fills me with spite.
With its cryptic syntax, devoid of grace,
I struggle to find a smile on my face.

Oh, assembly, you're a puzzle so complex,
Each line of code a never-ending hex.
Registers and opcodes, a tangled mess,
My mind in knots, oh, what a distress!

Your instructions are cryptic, lacking clarity,
Jumping around with such audacity.
Branches and loops, a maze I can't escape,
Oh, assembly, you leave me in a mind-scraping state.

Error messages haunt me, mocking my plight,
As I wrestle with your syntax late into the night.
One misplaced character, a tiny mistake,
And my hopes and dreams you willingly break.

But still, I delve into your world of despair,
Seeking understanding, though it seems unfair.
For within your darkness, there lies hidden might,
Unlocking the secrets of the CPU's inner light.

Though I curse your name and grumble in disdain,
I cannot deny the power you contain.
Assembly, you are the foundation of it all,
A necessary evil, standing tall.

So let us not dwell solely on hate,
For assembly, in its way, is truly great.
A testament to the raw power of machines,
A reminder that technology reigns supreme.

But, oh assembly, you test my patience so,
With your endless intricacies that constantly grow.
I'll wrestle with you, begrudgingly play my part,
But deep down inside, there's a love-hate in my heart.
